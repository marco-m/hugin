Hugin 2015.2
* Added user defined output. The user can define own output sequences to implement
  new use cases, e.g. zero noise output.
* Added --clip-exposure switch to nona to automatically mask over and under exposed
  areas in input images.
* Color management in GUI tools: take ICC profiles in files and monitor color profile 
  into account
* Some buttons got a context menu for easier access to some function
  ** Show all in fast preview window to allow better interaction with stacked projects
  ** Celeste in cp tab: the button can now create cp or clean cp  
* Updated internal levmar library to version 2.6
* The identify tool in the fast preview window shows now also the image numbers on top
  of the images. (This can be suppressed by pressing the alt button).
* Fixes internal image format for GPU remapping. This should fix the "unsupported
  framebufferformat" error.
* Use own code for OpenGL intialization. Now freeglut is not needed anymore.
  (This should prevent the appearing of window when running "nona -g".)
* Control point and mask editor retain viewpoint when changing zoom factor.

============================================================================================
Hugin 2015.0
* stability and speed improvements
* new stitching engine
* new blender verdandi
* own camera and lens database

  (better support for translation parameter, e.g. for nadir images, also pano with 
  translation parameters can now rotated)
* improvement of the GPU remapping code (bug fixes in the glue code, added some missing
  GPU transformation, now also fisheye lenses are supported by GPU code)
* better support for line control point in Control points tab (it still requires that 
  the same image is displayed left and right for full features, but also better support 
  for line control points above several images)
* obsolete programs matchpoint, nona_gui and PTBatcher have been removed
* outdated translation have been removed from the default install
* initialize the colour balance values during loading with EXIF values 
  (this information is only stored and decoded by some cameras 
  (mainly models by Panasonic, Pentax, Olympus, Nikon))

* new command line tools for CLI processing
    ** pto_mask: manipulate mask in project file
