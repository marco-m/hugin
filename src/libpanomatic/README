This is an experimental version of panomatic http://aorlinsk2.free.fr/panomatic/

Development goals are:

 - Standalone keypoint generator (keypoints) + matcher (panomatic) executables.
 - Patent free descriptor algorithm, while still allowing to use SURF (if enabled during compilation)
 - library for easy integration with existing software.


USAGE: 

As before. By default, the patented SURF descriptor is not compiled, and thus
cannot be used.

If support for SURF has been build into panomatic, SURF is used by default,
and the new patent-free descriptor can be used by specifing --grad.
on the keypoints or panomatic command line.

The panomatic default parameters might not be optimal for the new descriptor,
these might be better (just paste into the hugin preferences):
--sieve1size 100 --sieve2size 2 -o %o %i

The --kdtreeseconddist parameter is another tuning knob that could be used to
remove more wrong matches (try lower values, if too many bad correspondences
are found).

BUILDING:

$ mkdir build_release
$ cd build_release
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo .. # optinally used -DENABLE_SURF, if you are not concerned by the SURF patent.
$ make
$ make install   # optional, just use build_release/panomatic/panomatic instead.
