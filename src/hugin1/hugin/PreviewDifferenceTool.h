/* The PreviewDifferenceTool finds the topmost image underneath the mouse
 * pontier, which it cancels the normal draw for, and then subtracts it from the
 * rest of the images.
 * It is meant to be the fast preview's equivalent of the accurate preview's
 * difference mode.
 * WARNING: Since the fast preview is approximate, this will show errors that
 * don't really exist.
