      <p>17. April 1960 - 21. July 2010
      </p>
      </center>
      <p>Milko was born and raised in Germany.  His life long passion was
      "deep depth of field" in photography.  In 1995 he was one of a few to
      pioneer immersive digital virtual reality imaging.  He was an engaged
      and engaging member of the panoramic photography world, always ready
      to share his latest techniques and to listen to others.
      </p>
      <p>He was pursuing his passion, making a living as a photographer and
      building a career as a visual artist in Vancouver, Canada, when a
      virulent form of cancer suddenly and unexpectedly put a premature
      end to his life.
      </p>
      <p>The tragic circumstances of his passing have been compounded by
      his marital situation.  To these days we do not know the whereabouts
      of his legacy of panoramas and we fear that very little remains of
      it.</p>
      <p>He is survived by his mother and his brother.</p>
      <p>He will be missed.</p>
