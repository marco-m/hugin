Hugin is a versatile perspective manipulation programs suite for
the discerning user's panorama workflow and more.
</p><p>
Align images in geometrical and photometric space and merge them
into images that can't be captured with a single shot.
</p><p>
Applications range from the simple stitching of two images
into a panorama, up to giga pixel panoramas, high dynamic range
(HDR) composites, exposure blending, focus stacking and more.
