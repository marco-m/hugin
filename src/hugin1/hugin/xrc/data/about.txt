Hugin was originally developed by Pablo d'Angelo.
(C) 2004-2011

By setting his original software Free under the GPL, Pablo started
what has become a thriving community and a project larger than any
one single individual could have ever done alone.

Hugin is a versatile perspective manipulation programs suite for
the discerning user's panorama workflow and more.

Align images in geometrical and photometric space and merge them
into images that can't be captured with a single shot.

Applications range from the simple stitching of two images
into a panorama, up to giga pixel panoramas, high dynamic range
(HDR) composites, exposure blending, focus stacking and more.
