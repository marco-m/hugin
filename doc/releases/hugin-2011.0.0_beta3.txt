* Launchpad:    https://launchpad.net/hugin


SCHEDULE

https://launchpad.net/hugin/2011.0

The purpose of the schedule is to make the process as predictable as possible
so that contributors can plan for their own contributions (e.g. translations
and bug fixes) and distributors can plan for the binary builds.

The schedule is just an indication.  The release will happen when it is ready.

EXECUTABLES

Users communities produce executables for their respective platforms.

A number of users have built recent snapshots and executables are likely to be
announced within a few days of this tarball release.

Watch http://groups.google.com/group/hugin-ptx for the announcements of binary
releases.  If you don't see a binary for your platform it has most likely not
been produced yet.  Consider stepping up to the task.  Instructions at

CHANGES SINCE 2010.4.0

Only two months have passed since our last release and yet there have been
major changes.  Hugin's own control point generator CPFind has been
significantly improved; the last project from the 2010 Google Summer of Code
has been integrated; many general improvements have been made.


_Improved Built-in Control Points Generator_

CPFind's detection ability has been significantly improved, especially for
wide angle (> FOV 65Â°) images, fisheye images, and rotated images.  Anecdotal
evidence shows it to be more accurate than any other CP detector ever used
with Hugin.  A thorough, scientific comparison against other CP detectors
is welcome.  If you have well formed comparison results, please publish a link
on the Hugin mailing list at http://groups.google.com/group/hugin-ptx/


_Improved Fast Preview_

An Overview pane has been added to the Fast Preview window.  Users can now
interact with the panosphere like in a virtual reality viewer in real time
and visualize all areas of the panorama with little distortion, including
the zenith and nadir that are typically excessively distorted in the flat
preview.

It is now possible to drag individual images or arbitrary groups of images
on the panosphere in the fast preview.

A new gray point picker has been added for visual white balance correction.


_Registration of Stereo Images_

align_image_stack is commonly used for the alignment of slightly misaligned
images, e.g. for creating a High Dynamic Range image  from multiple exposures
when the camera was hand held.

It has been extended with additional functionality for the registration of
stereo images.


_Other Improvements_

* Man pages are now compressed and the generation is integrated in the CMake
  process (Linux).
* New Thoby projection modeling 10.5mm Nikkor fisheye lens
* Improved support for some keyboard shortcuts
* New Preferences: output file format (LDR only)
* This release has the usual bugfixes and adds minor features.


_Libraries and Build_

* CMake 2.8 or newer is now required
* Support has been added for gcc-4.6 compiler
* Libpano13 needs to be at least 2.9.18


_Control point generators_

Since 2010.4 Hugin ships with its own 'Patent Free' control point generator.
Third-party generators are still supported through the plug-in architecture.
CPFind is the recommended control point generator and the only one that has
the endorsement of the Hugin project team.


_Upgrading_

Upgrading from previous versions of Hugin should be seamless. If you do have
problems with old settings, these can be reset in the Preferences by clicking
'Load defaults'.

It is strongly recommended to set the default control point detector to
Hugin's CPFind.


_Compiling_

For users compiling from source:
* Hugin uses the wxWidgets GUI toolkit version >=2.7.0.
  2.9 support is experimental. 2.8.11 is recommended.
* boost >=1.34 is required.  The following boost libraries are used:
   * filesystem
   * graph
   * iostreams
   * regex
   * signals
   * system
   * thread
* Hugin requires a libtiff library with LZW support.
* Hugin depends on libpano13 version >=2.9.18
* Hugin requires GLEW the OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library,
  freeglut the OpenGL utility toolkit, and libGLU the OpenGL utility library.
* On Linux/Unix systems, libraries are now installed in a private location.
  This simplifies things for users who want to run multiple versions of Hugin
  simultaneously.
* On Linux/Unix systems, Hugin can be compiled with gcc-4.4.4, gcc-4.5.1,
  and gcc-4.6.
* On Windows, Hugin can be compiled with MSVC 2008 and MSVC 2010.
  The (free) Express Edition is enough, although it lacks OpenMP support.
* The build process requires CMake version >=2.8
