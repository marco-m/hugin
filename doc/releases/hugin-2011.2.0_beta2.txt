Hugin-2011.2.0_beta2 RELEASE NOTES  WORK IN PROGRESS NOT TO BE RELEASED YET

Hugin is a panorama stitcher and more.  A new version is available.


SCHEDULE

https://launchpad.net/hugin/2011.2

The purpose of the schedule is to make the process as predictable as possible
so that contributors can plan for their own contributions (e.g. translations
and bug fixes) and distributors can plan for the binary builds.

The schedule is just an indication.  The release will happen when it is ready.


DOWNLOAD

The 2011.2beta2 source tarball can be downloaded
* from sourceforge at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/hugin/files/hugin/hugin-2011.2_beta/hugin-2011.2.0_beta2.tar.bz2/download

* from launchpad at

This is a source code release.  For executables see below.

This tarball is equivalent to rev/changeset EDIT in our Mercurial
repository, where it is also tagged 2011.2beta2

EXECUTABLES

Users communities produce executables for their respective platforms.

A number of users have built recent snapshots and executables are likely to be
announced within a few days of this tarball release.

Watch http://groups.google.com/group/hugin-ptx for the announcements of binary
releases.  If you don't see a binary for your platform it has most likely not
been produced yet.  Consider stepping up to the task.  Instructions at

TRANSLATIONS

New strings have been added.  Now is a good time to help update your language.

RELEASE MANAGEMENT

I've been running most of the releases of the past two years.  I will be
stepping down from this role latest September 6, 2011 because of other
time committments.

There is a possibility that 2011.2 will be left orphaned in the middle of
the release cycle, and Hugin needs volunteers to step in for future releases.

If you want to step up to the task, I will be happy to hand over to you
immediately and mentor you through this release process.  Please contact us
at http://groups.google.com/group/hugin-ptx

The process is documented in detail at

http://wiki.panotools.org/Development_of_Open_Source_tools#Release

And you can count on me mentoring you through it.


USER-CONTRIBUTED ARTWORK

To promote artists using Hugin the project embellishes the
application's splash screen and the official release notes
on the Hugin web page with one artwork generated with Hugin
and selected by popular vote.

For this release, the runner up from the previous vote
will be used.

Users have contributed a number of interesting ideas to
the selection process for the future and a permanent
contribution and voting facility will be set up for
future editions.


CHANGES SINCE 2011.0.0

Little time has passed since our last release and yet there is new major
functionality.  Hugin has received a Python scripting interface and new
lens calibration tool.  A critical bug affecting a significant number of
Mac users has been fixed and many general improvements have been made.


_Lens Calibration Tool_

Lenses are designed to follow a perfect geometric model.  For rectilinear
lenses, a straight line in the depicted scene should be straight in the
picture.  This is not always the case:  most lenses have an inherent
deviation from the perfect model, resulting in imperfections such as
pincushion or barrel distortion in rectilinear lenses.

Adherence to the perfect geometric model is desirable for aesthetic purposes
and indespensible to achieve proper alignment when stitching images.
Hugin can calculate lens distortion parameters on the fly when optimizing
a project, however this requires more control points and more computational
effort than a project starting with a calibrated lens, and is prone to more
errors.

The new lens calibration tool calculates the distortion parameters of a
lens based on an input image.  The input image must contain straight
lines, ideally many of them at different distances from the center of the
lens, covering at least 1/4 of the image.  The calculated parameters are
valid for a given combination of focal distance, aperture (F-stop), and
sensor.

The values, saved into a lens profile, can be used in Hugin to achieve
a better stitch, or on single images taken with this lens / settings
combination to achieve a more aesthetically pleasing outcome.


_Python Scripting Interface_

Hugin now exposes some of its data structure and functionalities through
a Python module.  To get started with scripting, start your Python
interpreter and type:

   >>> import hsi
   >>> help (hsi)

Standalone Python programs can access a panorama object with Hugin's
functionality.  It is possible to develop complete command line and
even GUI tools based on this module.


_Python Plugin Interface_

Hugin can now run Python scripts inside the application.  In an enabled
Hugin binary, a new "Actions" menu gives access to system-wide plugins
distributed with Hugin.  Moreover, plugins can be written, modified,
customized in the user's own directory.

Currently there are only a few plugins available, but we expect the
body of available plugins and functionality to grow organically as
the interface is being made available to the general public.


_Other Improvements_

* PTBatcherGUI has matured to become the default processor for
  stitching projects.
* ICC profiles saved in output.
* Support for newer Olympus camera.
* Improved auto cropping.
* New mask type: exclude region from all images shot with the same lens
* Copy&paste of masks in Mask Tab
* Show extent of active masks and crop in Mask Editor
* Fix for critical issue affecting stitching on Mac OS X Leopard.
* Many more improvements and bug fixes.


_Libraries and Build_

The Python interface introduces new dependencies:
* SWIG >2.0
* Python


_Control point generators_

Since 2010.4 Hugin ships with its own control point generator CPFind.
Third-party generators are still supported through the plug-in architecture.
CPFind is the recommended control points generator and the only one that has
the endorsement of the Hugin project team.


_Upgrading_

Upgrading from previous versions of Hugin should be seamless. If you do have
problems with old settings, these can be reset in the Preferences by clicking
'Load defaults'.

It is strongly recommeded to set the default control point detector to
Hugin's CPFind.


_Compiling_

For users compiling from source:
* Hugin uses the wxWidgets GUI toolkit version >=2.7.0.
  2.9 support is experimental. 2.8.11 is recommended.
* boost >=1.34 is required.  The following boost libraries are used:
   * filesystem
   * graph
   * iostreams
   * regex
   * signals
   * system
   * thread
* Hugin requires a libtiff library with LZW support.
* Hugin depends on libpano13 version >=2.9.18
* Hugin requires GLEW the OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library,
  freeglut the OpenGL utility toolkit, and libGLU the OpenGL utility library.
* Building the Python module is optional.  SWIG>2.0 and Python are required.
  To build it, configure BUILD_HSI=ON before compiling.
  The Python module is currently not supported on Mac OS X for lack of
  development resources but we hope to get it working during the current
  release cycle or shortly thereafter.
* On Linux/Unix systems, libaries are installed in a private location.
  This simplifies things for users who want to run multiple versions of Hugin
  simultaneously.
* On Linux/Unix systems, Hugin can be compiled with gcc-4.4.4, gcc-4.5.1,
  and gcc-4.6.
* On Windows, Hugin can be compiled with MSVC 2008 and MSVC 2010.
  The (free) Express Edition is enough, although it lacks OpenMP support.

Thanks to all the contributors to this release and members of the hugin-ptx
mailing list, too many to mention here.
