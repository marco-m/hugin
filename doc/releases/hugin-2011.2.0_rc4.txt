Hugin-2011.2.0_rc4 RELEASE NOTES

ABOUT

Hugin is more than just a panorama stitcher.  A new version is available.
This is a release candidate and may be declared a final release in a few days.
This release candidate is the same as rc3 with two exception:  a new Danish
translation has been added and the Dutch translation has been updated.

Hugin can be found at
* SourceForge:  http://hugin.sourceforge.net/
* Launchpad:    https://launchpad.net/hugin

EXECUTABLES

Users communities produce executables for their respective platforms.

These executables are then added to the download section on SourceForge at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/hugin/files/hugin/

A number of users have built recent snapshots and executables are likely to be
announced within a few days of this tarball release.

Watch http://groups.google.com/group/hugin-ptx for the announcements of binary
releases.  If you don't see a binary for your platform it has most likely not
been produced yet.  Consider stepping up to the task.  Instructions at

CHANGES SINCE 2011.0.0

Little time has passed since our last release and yet there is new major
functionality.  Hugin has received a Python scripting interface and new
lens calibration tool.  A critical bug affecting a significant number of
Mac users has been fixed and many general improvements have been made.


_Lens Calibration Tool_

Lenses are designed to follow a perfect geometric model.  For rectilinear
lenses, a straight line in the depicted scene should be straight in the
picture.  This is not always the case:  most lenses have an inherent
deviation from the perfect model, resulting in imperfections such as
pincushion or barrel distortion in rectilinear lenses.

Adherence to the perfect geometric model is desirable for aesthetic purposes
and indespensible to achieve proper alignment when stitching images.
Hugin can calculate lens distortion parameters on the fly when optimizing
a project, however this requires more control points and more computational
effort than a project starting with a calibrated lens, and is prone to more
errors.

The new lens calibration tool calculates the distortion parameters of a
lens based on an input image.  The input image must contain straight
lines, ideally many of them at different distances from the center of the
lens, covering at least one quadrant of the image.  The calculated
parameters are valid for a given combination of focal distance,
aperture (F-stop), and sensor.

The values, saved into a lens profile, can be used in Hugin to achieve
a better stitch, or on single images taken with this lens / settings
combination to achieve a more aesthetically pleasing outcome.


_Python Scripting Interface_

Hugin now exposes some of its data structure and functionalities through
a Python module.  To get started with scripting, start your Python
interpreter and type:

   >>> import hsi
   >>> help (hsi)

Standalone Python programs can access a panorama object with Hugin's
functionality.  It is possible to develop complete command line and
even GUI tools based on this module.

The Python Scripting Interface does not work on Mac OSX yet.


_Python Plugin Interface_

Hugin can now run Python scripts inside the application.  In an enabled
Hugin binary, a new "Actions" menu gives access to system-wide plugins
distributed with Hugin.  Moreover, plugins can be written, modified,
customized in the user's own directory.

Currently there are only a few plugins available, but we expect the
body of available plugins and functionality to grow organically as
the interface is being made available to the general public.

The Python Plugin Interface does not work on Mac OSX yet.


_Other Improvements_

* PTBatcherGUI has matured to become the default processor for
  stitching projects.
* ICC profiles saved in output.
* Support for newer Olympus camera.
* Improved auto cropping.
* New mask type: exclude region from all images shot with the same lens
* Copy&paste of masks in Mask Tab
* Show extent of active masks and crop in Mask Editor
* Fix for critical issue affecting stitching on Mac OS X Leopard.
* Many more improvements and bug fixes.


_Libraries and Build_

The Python interface introduces new dependencies:
* SWIG >2.0
* Python


UPGRADING

Upgrading from previous versions of Hugin should be seamless. If you do have
problems with old settings, these can be reset in the Preferences by clicking
'Load defaults'.

It is strongly recommeded to set the default control point detector to
Hugin's CPFind.  It is the only control point generator endorsed by Hugin.
Third-party generators may be compatible with the plug-in architecture.


COMPILING

Users compiling from source refer to the dependencies listed at
http://wiki.panotools.org/Development_of_Open_Source_tools#Dependencies

and the build processes listed at

More information in the README and INSTALL_cmake files in the tarball.


KNOWN ISSUES AND WORKAROUNDS

Fast Preview is affected by a threading issue.

Plane overview is wrong if opening fast preview window the first time
https://bugs.launchpad.net/hugin/+bug/726183


Panosphere Overview window seperated from the content
https://bugs.launchpad.net/hugin/+bug/726997


There is a known problem building Hugin with CMake 2.8.5rc2.
Workaround: Upgrade to a newer CMake version.


Mac OS X 10.7 Lion has been recently introduced by Apple.
Initial reports indicate that it is not compatible with Hugin.
Support will start as soon as possible.


An updated list of issues deemed to be critical, including discussions
and workarounds is in the issue tracker.

RELEASE MANAGEMENT

Hugin is looking for a new release manager.

The process is documented in detail at

http://wiki.panotools.org/Development_of_Open_Source_tools#Release

I will keep hanging out on Hugin-PTX and will gladly help the next
release manager transition into the role.


THANKS

Thanks to all the contributors to this release and members of the hugin-ptx
mailing list, too many to mention here.
