Other Improvements

  * Various improvements to cpfind including a prealign matching strategy and pair     wise matching for multirow heuristic
  * Added option to keep exposure fused stacks
  * pano_modify: Added HDR autocrop option
  * Many more improvements and bug fixes.


UPGRADING

Upgrading from previous versions of Hugin should be seamless. If you do have
problems with old settings, these can be reset in the Preferences by clicking
'Load defaults'.

It is strongly recommeded to set the default control point detector to
Hugin's CPFind.  It is the only control point generator endorsed by Hugin.
Third-party generators may be compatible with the plug-in architecture.

Users compiling from source refer to the dependencies listed at
