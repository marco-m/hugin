EXECUTABLES

Users communities produce executables for their respective platforms.

These executables are then added to the download section on SourceForge at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/hugin/files/hugin/

A number of users have built recent snapshots and executables are likely to be
announced within a few days of this tarball release.

Watch http://groups.google.com/group/hugin-ptx for the announcements of binary
releases.  If you don't see a binary for your platform it has most likely not
been produced yet.  Consider stepping up to the task.  Instructions at

CHANGES SINCE 2011.0.0

Little time has passed since our last release and yet there is new major
functionality.  Hugin has received a Python scripting interface and new
lens calibration tool.  A critical bug affecting a significant number of
Mac users has been fixed and many general improvements have been made.


_Lens Calibration Tool_

Lenses are designed to follow a perfect geometric model.  For rectilinear
lenses, a straight line in the depicted scene should be straight in the
picture.  This is not always the case:  most lenses have an inherent
deviation from the perfect model, resulting in imperfections such as
pincushion or barrel distortion in rectilinear lenses.

Adherence to the perfect geometric model is desirable for aesthetic purposes
and indespensible to achieve proper alignment when stitching images.
Hugin can calculate lens distortion parameters on the fly when optimizing
a project, however this requires more control points and more computational
effort than a project starting with a calibrated lens, and is prone to more
errors.

The new lens calibration tool calculates the distortion parameters of a
lens based on an input image.  The input image must contain straight
lines, ideally many of them at different distances from the center of the
lens, covering at least 1/4 of the image.  The calculated parameters are
valid for a given combination of focal distance, aperture (F-stop), and
sensor.

The values, saved into a lens profile, can be used in Hugin to achieve
a better stitch, or on single images taken with this lens / settings
combination to achieve a more aesthetically pleasing outcome.


_Python Scripting Interface_

Hugin now exposes some of its data structure and functionalities through
a Python module.  To get started with scripting, start your Python
interpreter and type:

   >>> import hsi
   >>> help (hsi)

Standalone Python programs can access a panorama object with Hugin's
functionality.  It is possible to develop complete command line and
even GUI tools based on this module.


_Python Plugin Interface_

Hugin can now run Python scripts inside the application.  In an enabled
Hugin binary, a new "Actions" menu gives access to system-wide plugins
distributed with Hugin.  Moreover, plugins can be written, modified,
customized in the user's own directory.

Currently there are only a few plugins available, but we expect the
body of available plugins and functionality to grow organically as
the interface is being made available to the general public.


_Other Improvements_

* PTBatcherGUI has matured to become the default processor for
  stitching projects.
* ICC profiles saved in output.
* Support for newer Olympus camera.
* Improved auto cropping.
* New mask type: exclude region from all images shot with the same lens
* Copy&paste of masks in Mask Tab
* Show extent of active masks and crop in Mask Editor
* Fix for critical issue affecting stitching on Mac OS X Leopard.
* Many more improvements and bug fixes.


_Libraries and Build_

The Python interface introduces new dependencies:
* SWIG >2.0
* Python


UPGRADING

Upgrading from previous versions of Hugin should be seamless. If you do have
problems with old settings, these can be reset in the Preferences by clicking
'Load defaults'.

It is strongly recommeded to set the default control point detector to
Hugin's CPFind.  It is the only control point generator endorsed by Hugin.
Third-party generators may be compatible with the plug-in architecture.

RELEASE MANAGEMENT

I've been running most of the Hugin releases for the past two years.
They would not have been possible without the many contributions from our
coders, translators, testers, sponsors.  My personal and heartfelt thanks
to all of you.

Due to new personal committments I won't be available for Hugin as I was
in the past.  Hugin needs a new release manager.

The process is documented in detail at

http://wiki.panotools.org/Development_of_Open_Source_tools#Release

I will keep hanging out on Hugin-PTX and will gladly help the next
release manager transition into the role.


THANKS

Thanks to all the contributors to this release and members of the hugin-ptx
mailing list, too many to mention here.

Hugin can be found at http://hugin.sourceforge.net/ and at https://launchpad.net/hugin
